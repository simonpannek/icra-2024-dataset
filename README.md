# icra-2024-dataset

This dataset integrates force sensing data at 180 Hz update rates and synchronized temporal OCT B-scan images collected at 20 frames a second. It was collected using a complex system consisting of a force-sensing tool in conjunction with a robot platform and a microscope with an integrated OCT system.

## Dataset I

|      |   |
|------|---|
| **Tool** | 25-gauge (OD=500 $\mu$m) sensorized instrument with optical fibers to detect tooltip forces \cite{pmid22810149}. Three fiber Bragg grating optical strain–sensing fibers were integrated into a 50-mm-long titanium wire of 0.5 mm diameter. Three square grooves (160 × 160 $\mu$m) along the wire were cut to position the fiber sensors. A medical device super glue (Loctite 4014; Henkel, Dusseldorf, Germany) was used to bond the fiber to the wire. A 3-mm-long 25-gauge bevel-tipped needle piece was attached to the titanium wire, which serves as the tool shaft, and the needle tip was bent at 30°. The instrument detects forces in 2-DoF (in the x and y planes, but not the axial z plane). |
| **Insertions** | 370 |
| **Eyes used** | 23 |

## Dataset II

|      |   |
|------|---|
| **Tool** | Similar to the tool used for Dataset I, but the tooltip consists of a distal portion (10 mm length) of a 36-gauge (OD=110 $\mu$m) micro-needle type INCYTO Needle-RNT (INCYTO Co., Ltd., Korea). |
| **Insertions** | 205 |
| **Eyes used** | 15 |
